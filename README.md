# bugs
## github router issue
  SPA route do not work on the github page, because github not support redirecting
## safari flex display 
  icons on the header is not working well on safari

# functions
## login page
    inactive login button when password or email is invalid 
    can automatically reset password and email when clicking login button and the password and email are not match 

    Only when user types email and password '123@123.com' and '123', the login is successful and then enter to the homepage.

## register page
   inactive register button when all input are valid. when it is valid, register button is active and the email will show the user's email address and then link to the homepage.

# advice
    login page-first when open the app
    would suggest to switch the positions between login page and registerpage
    changed the display password from 'Zeigen' into 'eye icon',troggle the 'eye open' amd 'eye close' icons and place it beside 'cross' or 'check' icons in order to make the user be able to check their password anytime doesn't matter it is right or wrong.
